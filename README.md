# artopninja
A web interface for Artop API

# Summary
This project (POC) aims to read an ARXML extract using python and send JSON data to a webserver also in python and display the data finally in a neatly designed HTML page. Since this is in the inception stage the functionality is less, as in, only a proof is shown, proof for revolutionary content later to come!

# Possible Features
 * Extract editing feature
 * User account system and asynchronous usage for many users (like google slides)
 * AI
 * Auto Mapping Feature
 * System Generation

# Usage
 * Open explorer.py and run it to start the server.
 * Navigate to http://localhost:8000 on your browser (chrome maybe)
 * Paste the ARXML path and press Open or enter.
 * Elements are populated and can be expanded like a tree

# Libraries and frameworks
I used a friend's python project to read ARXMLs and later load it into my script.
